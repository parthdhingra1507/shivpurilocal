MULTI-PAGE RESTRUCTURE - QUICK IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
====================================================

You have 3 options to complete this restructure:

OPTION 1: Use the existing single-page with hash routing (FASTEST - 2 min)
- Keep everything in index.html
- Use #transport, #places, #food in URLs
- Just update the category cards to use hash links
- Minimal changes needed

OPTION 2: Simple separate pages (RECOMMENDED - 10 min manual work)
- Copy index.html → transport.html, places.html, food.html
- In transport.html: Remove category cards, keep bus schedule
- In places.html: Remove category cards & bus schedule, add places grid
- In food.html: Remove category cards & bus schedule, add food grid
- Update script.js references in each file

OPTION 3: Full restructure with separate JS files (COMPLETE - what we started)
- Need to create 6 more files
- Most professional but takes longer

RECOMMENDATION: Go with Option 1 (hash routing) for now since:
- Works immediately
- Can upgrade to separate pages later
- No deployment issues
- Users won't notice the difference
